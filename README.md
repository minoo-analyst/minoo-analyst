Welcome to my project library!

I have been using AWS EC2 and S3 as my primary development and storage platforms for the past few years.
Please feel free to look at my AWS based Analysis projects on the fundamentals of Python tools (1-4), E-Commerce (5), Survey Data Analysis (6) and Payroll (7)!
   
Furthermore, the above projects are documented within my YouTube Channel:

Additionally, check out my latest projects which range from a variety subjects from Hospital ER Wait Times & Ratings (8), Credit Card Customer Groups (9), Employee Attrition Rates (10), and Airline Reviews (11-12)!
These are produced in Python, PowerBI & Tableau.
